- [ ] spread the word about the sweet ecosystem [Jeremy Evans](http://jeremyevans.net/) (Roda, [Rodauth](https://github.com/jeremyevans/rodauth), [Sequel](https://github.com/jeremyevans/sequel), [rack-unreloader](https://github.com/jeremyevans/rack-unreloader), and [many more](https://github.com/jeremyevans?tab=repositories)) has put in the universe ðŸ¥°
